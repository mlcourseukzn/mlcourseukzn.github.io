##### Week 2 - Day 3: Application

###### Dataset 1: Heart Disease
This data set dates from 1988 and consists of four databases: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V. It contains 76 attributes, including the predicted attribute, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. The "target" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued 0 = no disease and 1 = disease.

###### Attribute Information:

        age
        sex
        chest pain type (4 values)
        resting blood pressure
        serum cholestoral in mg/dl
        fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
        resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)
        maximum heart rate achieved
        exercise induced angina
        oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
        the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
        number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
        thal: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect
        The names and social security numbers of the patients were recently removed from the database, replaced with dummy values.
