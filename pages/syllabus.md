#### Course Description
Unprecedented advances in digital technology during the second half of the 20th and beginning of the 21st centuries is transforming science, including health and biomedical research. Scientific fields that have traditionally relied upon simple data analysis techniques of smaller datasets have been transformed by technologies that continue to expand the possibilities of observing and deciphering massive amounts of data in an unprecedented way. This course includes concepts from Statistics, Computer Science and Software Engineering. We will learn the necessary skills to manage, visualize and analyze data. We will learn concepts such as exploratory data analysis, statistical inference and modeling, machine learning, and visualization. We will also learn the necessary skills to develop data products including R programming, data wrangling, reproducible research, and communicating results.


#### Learning Objectives
This class focuses on methods for learning from data, in order to gain useful predictions and insights. Separating signal from noise presents many computational and inferential challenges, which we approach from a perspective at the interface of computer science and statistics. Through real-world examples of wide interest, we introduce methods for five key facets of an investigation:

1) Exploratory data analysis to generate hypotheses and intuition about the data;
2) Inference and prediction based on statistical tools such as modeling, regression, and classification;
3) Communication of results through visualization, stories, and interpretable summaries.

#### Final Project 
Students will work in small groups to work on data science project. The goal of the project is to go through the complete data science process to answer an assigned prompt. You will be given a dataset and series of questions to answer. You will design your visualizations, run statistical analyses, and communicate results. A full description is available on the course website.
