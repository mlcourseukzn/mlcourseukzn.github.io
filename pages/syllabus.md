#### Course Description
Unprecedented advances in digital technology during the second half of the 20th and beginning of the 21st centuries is transforming science, including health and biomedical research. Scientific fields that have traditionally relied upon simple data analysis techniques of smaller datasets have been transformed by technologies that continue to expand the possibilities of observing and deciphering massive amounts of data in an unprecedented way. This course includes concepts from Statistics, Computer Science and Software Engineering. We will learn the necessary skills to manage, visualize and analyze data. We will learn concepts such as exploratory data analysis, statistical inference and modeling, machine learning, and visualization. We will also learn the necessary skills to develop data products including R programming, data wrangling, reproducible research, and communicating results.


#### Learning Objectives
This class focuses on methods for learning from data, in order to gain useful predictions and insights. Separating signal from noise presents many computational and inferential challenges, which we approach from a perspective at the interface of computer science and statistics. Through real-world examples of wide interest, we introduce methods for five key facets of an investigation:
1) data munging/scraping/sampling/cleaning in order to construct an informative, manageable data set;
2) software engineering skills for accessing data as well as organizing data analyses and making these analyses sharable and reproducible;
3) exploratory data analysis to generate hypotheses and intuition about the data;
4) inference and prediction based on statistical tools such as modeling, regression, and classification;
5) communication of results through visualization, stories, and interpretable summaries.


#### What is the structure of this course?
We will learn these concepts through six data analysis projects. Grades will be based on:

* 4 homeworks (40%)
* 1 take-home midterm (25%)
* 1 final project (35%)


#### Homework Assignments
All homework assignments will involve writing code and communicating results. **Students must submit the RMarkdown file and knitted html file associated with each assignment in their individual repository**. A private repository for each assignment will be created for each student and will only be visible to the student and course teaching staff. 

Each student is given two late days per homework assignment. A late day extends the individual homework deadline by 24 hours without penalty. No more than two late days may be used on any one assignment. Late days are intended to give students flexibility: students can use them for any reason, no questions asked. Student don’t get any bonus points for not using late days. Also, students can only use late days for the individual homework deadlines - all other deadlines (e.g., project milestones, midterm exam) are hard.

Although each student is given late days, we will be accepting homework from students that pass this limit. However, we will be deducting 10% (10 points) for each extra late day.

**Due to the unpredictable nature of COVID-19 students in need of extra time to complete assignments should reach out to Student Affairs at StudentAffairs@hsph.harvard.edu. A staff member will work with you and Dr. Mattie to accommodate you. You can also contact Student Affairs if you have a learning disability that requires accommodations. We will ensure you are accommodated as needed.**

The TFs must be able to knit submitted RMarkdown files. The penalty for not being able to knit a file while grading increases for each subsequent homework – see breakdown below. To avoid this, students should be sure to include relative paths to files, data, images, etc. rather than absolute paths. Examples of how to include paths will be given in lecture and lab sessions. Students may also double check with the teaching staff before submitting assignments. 

* 0 points for HW1
* 5 points for HW2
* 10 points for HW3
* 15 points for HW4

**Students may ask questions about the assignments during lecture, but we ask that any questions about grading be directed to the TFs or Dr. Mattie outside of lecture and lab sessions via email.**

#### Take-home Midterm
A take-home midterm will be distributed in the form of an RMarkdown file in October (date TBD) to test comprehension of course material. The exam will consist of multiple-choice questions that may or may not require writing code, coding questions and short answer questions. All code used and text answers must be submitted using the RMarkdown file. Students will have 1 week to work on the exam and must submit the exam via Canvas by 11:59pm on the deadline (TBD). **Students are encouraged to use lecture slides and code, lab material, homework assignments and the Internet to work on the exam, but may not work or consult with other students. The teaching staff will be available to answer any questions concerning the exam.**

We will ensure you are accommodated as needed.**

#### Final Project 
Students will work in small groups on a month-long data science project. The goal of the project is to go through the complete data science process to answer an assigned prompt. You will be given a dataset and series of questions to answer. You will design your visualizations, run statistical analyses, and communicate results. A full description is available on the course website.

#### Required Textbook
None. Instead, we have a list of recommended readings on the website.

#### Course Communication
We will use Slack to organize course discussions. Each lecture will have a channel that
will be monitored by the TFs during class. Feel free to ask questions during class, or anytime. [Join Slack here!](https://join.slack.com/t/bst2192022/shared_invite/zt-1dyho6m46-s3TQ2RV5W8t_YZ0TDMGvvA) More information on how to use Slack is posted on our [Resources](http://coredatascience.github.io/pages/resources.html) page.
